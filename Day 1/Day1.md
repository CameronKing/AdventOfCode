# Day 1

Your government has become very concerned with the spread of misinformation. To address this grave concern, it has created a new social network where you can discuss with other people and come to the right conclusions.

To avoid having influencers that rapidly spread fake news, the government has assigned everyone a place on a square grid, and you are only allowed to talk to your four immediate neighbors.

The first question the government would like everyone to agree on is whether the earth is flat or a sphere.

The rules for discussions are simple: each hour, the government selects a random person, who then has to talk to their four neighbors and poll them. If the majority of the five people in the discussion thinks the earth is a sphere, then, miraculously, all five become convinced of that; vice versa, if the majority thinks it's flat, everyone believes that now.

So that everyone has four neighbors and nobody feels like they're on the boundary, and in order not to bias anyone about the flatness of the world, the people in the social network exist on a torus.

How long does it take, on average, for everyone to agree if initially opinions are divided 50:50? How long if they are divided 90:10?
