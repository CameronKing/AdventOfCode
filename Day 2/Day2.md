# Day 2

After hearing many complaints that people would like to disagree with their neighbors, the government hires the Wolff consulting firm to come up with a better model of discussions.

They propose a new model for discussions:
1. Again, the government randomly selects one person. This person is presented evidence contrary to their current belief about the topology of earth that is so incredibly convicing that they are guaranteed to change their mind about it.
2. They are so excited about their new insights that they talk to all their neighbors that agree with their old view and try to convince them to also change their minds. This succeeds with probability $p$.
3. Those neighbors that are swayed by the new evidence now in turn talk to all of their formerly agreeing neighbors (that haven't already been talked to by someone else in this round) and try to get them to change their minds faced with this new evidence.
4. This continues until the group can't grow any more, and everyone who was convinced records their change of mind.

How large does $p$ have to be so that a non-zero fraction of the world's population change their mind every hours?
